## Description

This program is designed to serve as a user-friendly tool that can be used to save notes that are stored to a database where they can be reviewed at a later time, and deleted when no longer needed.

## Installation

This program requires Node.js and NPM. Once these are installed please run:
```
npm init -y

npm i express

npm i uuid
```
It also appears that using nodemon works better than node. Further work will be done to determine why this is the case. It is recommended that the user run:
```
nodemon server.js

```
instead of:
```
node server.js
```
To install nodemon globally, please issue the following command in terminal:
```
npm install --global nodemon
```
